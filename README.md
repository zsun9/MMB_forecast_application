## Model Implementation Guidance

### Read the paper

- Download the original paper + online appendix + data files + programming files, and store them in the 'Reference' folder
- Read through the paper and code, and create a readme file to record the following information: Title, Authors, Publication information, Summary of the paper, Summary of the model(s), Common observables, Unique observables
- Specify how unique observables are constructed (if any)
- Highlight any other specific features of the model (e.g., whether the data is de-trended, whether the estimation method is non-standard, etc.)
- A **readme template** can be found in the root folder

### Collect and transform data

### Check the forecast performance

### Run estimation and generate forecasts

(1) Download the time series for the original paper, and check which series are already included in the 


(1) download real-time data (and data definitions) from ALFRED using the API
(2) save rawdata (and data definitions) to disk
(3) collect raw variables for a given observation date
(4) transform raw variables to observed variables in the model
