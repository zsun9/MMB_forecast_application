Instruction to replicate the results for "Forecasting with DSGE models with Financial Frictions" - by Marcin Kolasa and Micha³ Rubaszek

1. Create Folder FFforecasting
2. Add Dynare 4.2.4 folder \\Dynare\4.2.4

There are three models:
dssw 		- baseline
dssw_ff 	- model with financial frictions in the corporate sector
dssw_hh		- model with financial frictions in the housing sector

Important! Since we use parallel computing, we have used Pstools (see http://www.dynare.org/DynareWiki/ParallelDynare). The setting of our computer are in dynare.ini
