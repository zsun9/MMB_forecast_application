Summary of paper:
By constructing the model that accounts for the joint behavior of labor and goods market, as well as inflation, this paper uncovers the key forces driving the US economy in the Great Recession.

Summary of model:
Extended medium-sized DSGE model endogenizing the labor force participation rate
Shocks: 1. financial wedge 2. consumption wedge 3. technology shock 4. fiscal policy shock

Specific estimation method:
Estimate the model using a particular Bayesian strategy that minimizes the distance between the dynamic response to three shocks in the model and the analog objects in the data, which is obtained using an identified VAR for postwar quarterly US times series that include key labor market variables. The strategy is developed in Christiano, Trabandt, and Walentin (2010).
