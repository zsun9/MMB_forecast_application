{\Large Readme file for replicating the estimation results in
\textquotedblleft Housing Market Spillovers: Evidence from an Estimated DSGE
Model\textquotedblright\ (AEJ:\ Macro), by Matteo Iacoviello and Stefano Neri%
}

The directory \texttt{aej\_spillovers} contains the files for replication
the main results of our paper.

It contains the following files:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{jules1.mod}: main dynare file for either: (a)\ estimating the
model; or (b) plotting impulse responses/doing post-estimation analysis;

\item \texttt{jules1\_steadystate.m}:\ file containing the calculations of
the steady state of the model;

\item \texttt{US\_data\_65Q106Q4.m}:\ file containing the observable
variables for the estimation.

\item \texttt{rideaej1.m:\ }main file that changes default directory and
launches \texttt{jules1.mod} file above
\end{enumerate}

To launch the programs, change Matlab's current directory to the directory
where the \texttt{aej\_spillovers} is (e.g., \texttt{c:\TEXTsymbol{\backslash%
}aej\_spillovers}), and launch from the Matlab command prompt the file 
\texttt{rideaej1}. Make sure Dynare 4 is correctly installed.

Although we have performed estimation and robustness analysis and various
tests using our own codes, we find it easier to share a \textquotedblleft
mod\textquotedblright\ file since Dynare is by and large the standard
language for solving, simulating and estimating a large class of dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium models.

The mod file lists all the equations of our model, as in Appendix B of our
paper. The user can select one of two options inside the mod file. Setting
the option \texttt{DO\_IRF=1} (line 120 of the \texttt{mod} file) plots the
impulse responses of our estimated model to all shocks. Setting the option 
\texttt{DO\_ESTIMATION=1} (line 121)\ runs the estimation.

The files above were written and tested for \texttt{Dynare 4.0.4} and 
\texttt{Matlab 7.6.0} using a PC running Windows XP.
