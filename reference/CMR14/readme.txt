Unique observables:
Hours worked,

1 The authors claim that their data are in net growth terms (that is the logged first difference) net of sample mean, but they are in fact all in gross growth terms, in which the sample mean is not subtracted from the series.
2 In the paper, some aggregates are converted to per-capita terms based on the annual (interpolated) population data from the OECD, not from the BLS.
3 Consumption = PCE Services + PCE Non-durables, Investment = PCE Durables + FPI, and they are all deflated by their own deflators.
