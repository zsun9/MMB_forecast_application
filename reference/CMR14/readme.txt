Summary of paper: The authors augment a standard DSGE modelto include a Bernanke-Gertler-Gilchrist financial accelerator. They fit the model to US data, allowing the volatility of cross-sectional idiosyncratic uncertainty to fluctuate over time. They refer to this measure of volatility as risk and find that fluctuations in risk are the most important shock driving the business cycle.

Summary of model:

Common observables:
GDP growth, wage growth, federal funds rate, inflation, credit, term spread, risk premium

Specific observables:
Consumption growth, investment growth, hours worked, relative price of investment goods, net worth

1 The authors claim that their data are in net growth terms (that is the logged first difference) net of sample mean, but they are in fact all in gross growth terms, in which the sample mean is not subtracted from the series.
2 In the paper, some aggregates are converted to per-capita terms based on the annual (interpolated) population data from the OECD, not from the BLS.
3 Consumption = PCE Services + PCE Non-durables, Investment = PCE Durables + FPI, and they are all deflated by their own deflators.
